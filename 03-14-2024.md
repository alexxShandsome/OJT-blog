# 28th Day of On The Job Training

Today we decided to present again to one of our panelists about our Capstone 2 probject,
because we need to have a grade in our Capstone 2. The need for a grade is getting
desperate because we are aiming to graduate on time.

I didn't do much about the OJT because my mind is focused in getting ready in the
presentation for our Capstone 2.

And... the panelist gave us finally a grade. The grade is 92, that's pretty good enough
for me. I can't really complain. I just need to graduate, get a job, and support my
family.
