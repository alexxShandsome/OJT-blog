# 22th Day of On The Job Training

Today is a special day; one of my teammates named Sean treated us to lunch to celebrate
his birthday last week. We just ordered a takeout set, but that's enough for lunch.

We were also visited by a representative from Vives University in our workplace. Well, I
did not entertain the guest because I have nothing much to say. So, one of my teammates
named Marcus handled the talking. That's me on the far left of the picture.
