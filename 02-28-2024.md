# 17th Day of On The Job Training

Today is the first formal day that I will be working from home. Nothing exciting happened,
just me chilling away from the troubles of social life. The only challenge is that
starting the flow state to work is hard. The feeling of wanting to laze around is strong.
That's why the amount of OJT work I performed is only a few.

## Activities Performed

I made a decision to use the new database schema that I created. I realized that I need to
utilize the new database schema because what I did for the past days was a shallow
estimate with no practical application yet. As early as now, I should discover and report
to my teammates the problems and challenges I encountered switching to the new schema.
That is to make sure and have assurance that I'm not making any rash decisions.

## Final Thoughts

I have no picture today, and I hesitated to get a screenshot of the code snippets due to
the concern that those code snippets might become a security vulnerability. After all,
where I'm writing this blog is a public GitHub repository.
