# 21th Day of On The Job Training

Today is kind of a special day. The original team of BiNNO finally defended their capstone
project for the Capstone 2 subject. So, after school, or the term should be after work, we
decided to celebrate by eating outside for dinner. I'm seated with individuals that I'm
not close to, so I just ate my food silently. The anxiety feeling is not that strong
because, at this time, I'm used to eating alone in the mall; I call it "Me Time."

## Activities Performed

Same as yesterday, I just refactored some back-end code again. I know the answer is
getting repetitive, well that's because it's just what I do on a daily basis.
