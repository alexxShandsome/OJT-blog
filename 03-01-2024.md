# 19th Day of On The Job Training

The day after working from home feels great. It's refreshing to see the faces of my fellow
OJT teammates. Since it's Friday, my urge to end the week is strong, so my productivity
was affected slightly.

## Activities Performed

Today, I refactored the back-end code for the events feature and utilized the new database
I created. The job was pretty huge, so huge that it took my whole day to finish it. The
reason for that is because I also fixed the code readability and applied the proper JSDoc
code documentation format for each function.

That's what I did for the whole day, nothing much special happened.
