# 12th Day of On The Job Training

Today is Wednesday, which is also called Wash Day. On Wash Day, students can wear casual
civilian wear instead of the standard uniform. Sadly, I can't do that because we decided
today that we will take a pictorial for our system's developer members. I even left my
phone in my father's tricycle on the way to our office. So, after settling my things in
the office, I came back home again to get my phone. It's a stressful day thanks to our
country's hot weather.

## Activities Performed

Same as yesterday, I improved the system's database and ERD.

## Final Thoughts

The **Activities Performed** sections is short because that's all that I did this day.
