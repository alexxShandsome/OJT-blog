# 16th Day of On The Job Training

Today, we decided to work from home. Why? Because our workplace will be used to conduct an
entrepreneurship seminar. According to our supervisor or mentor, the seminar will be
conducted until Thursday, which is the 29th of February. We were told this while we were
already in the workplace. Changing the work environment takes time to adjust, that's why I
started to perform my duties in the afternoon.

## Activities Performed

For the afternoon, I started testing the queries for the new database. Since the back-end
codebase is huge, I started on the blog feature, specifically working on the
Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) operations for the blogs. The job is not easy because I
also focused on the consistency and readability of the code.

## Final Thoughts

It's a bummer that we are going to work from home. The reason for that is my house has a
lot of distractions, like people asking pointless questions, who can't see that I'm doing
something. But it has its own perks, free food and a comfort zone in this sometimes
challenging world.

This is us; that's me in the back. I'm walking with these two individuals on their way
home, and we are going to watch the train passing.
