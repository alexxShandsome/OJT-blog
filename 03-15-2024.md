# 29th Day of On The Job Training

Today our Panel Chairman for Capstone 2 decided to gave my team a grade.

According to our Capstone Advisor, it is equivalent to 1.2. That's pretty good enough. But
we still need to work on our paper revisions, consult our capstone panelists and advisors,
and finally be ready for bookbinding. According to our Capstone Advisor we can't graduate
if we don't have a bookbind of our Capstone paper. He set the deadline to April 15 which
is 4 weeks from now.
