# 5th Day of On The Job Training

The 5th day is Monday. Stereotypically, according to memes and social media, Mondays are
when the body is feeling heavy, and on weekdays, the body is starting to rejoice. It is
probably because the majority of people really don't like working a lot. Burnouts due to
the same routines are no joke. I don't feel the burnout yet, probably in the near future.

## Activities Performed

I reviewed the past ERD design I created, added some improvements, and addressed missed
details. One can't be too sure that things are flawless or perfect. Fortunately, the
project hasn't reached the deployment phase yet, so early mistakes are still forgivable.
I also processed my JURAT and Training Agreement Waiver on which I will claim tomorrow
which is February 13.

## Final Thoughts

Nothing much happened this day. It's peaceful, yet the lunch meal is still expensive.
I decided that tomorrow I will cook my own lunch meal. These meal prices in the canteen
is getting annoying. This is probably the most practical decision I can come up with.
