# 15th Day of On The Job Training

Today, my OJT adviser visited my workplace. Nothing much happened, but the atmosphere was
friendly. We exchanged jokes and gags, to the point that I couldn't keep up with the
embarrassment. He even gave my team a free "puto," which was nice. We ate it all, and it
tasted fine. By the end of the day, the puto was nowhere to be seen.

## Activities Performed

The first task I remember today is the improvement of a module in which I created a
function that enables the deduction of the amount of contents in the statistics if a
content is deleted or archived. I also discussed with a fellow back-end programmer about
the structure of a specific table in the database. When working in a team, consulting or
asking for ideas before committing to a change is important.

Another task I remember today is explaining to my OJT adviser what I do. I should explain
it again in this blog. What I do is back-end programming; I handle the programming of the
system, which involves the processing of data and storage in the database. I also
actively maintain the database. I also do some System Administration stuff in our VPS.
I'm not well-versed or an expert when it comes to User Interface or User Experience. If
it were up to me, I'm satisfied with a black and white design.

## Final Thoughts

It looks like an event is going to happen tommorow in our workplace because one of the staff
members started organizing the chairs and tables. It would be nice if there's a food
catering that will happen, and we are included. Free lunch.
