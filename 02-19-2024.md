# 10th Day of On The Job Training

Another Monday, another week of work...

<br>

## Activities Performed

Today, I finished creating the API endpoints needed for our system's new feature (FAQ and
UAQ). Surprisingly, it was easy to the point that I didn't need to rely too much on
ChatGPT or Google. That's what I did for the whole morning shift.

In the afternoon, I practiced around our system's VPS (Virtual Private Server). I
installed the CLI (Command-line interface) tools I needed because the server doesn't have
a GUI (Graphical User Interface). Since I've been using the Linux operating system for a
long time now, I've become comfortable using CLI tools. CLI tools are lightweight and
powerful; that's why, in my opinion, IT students should at least learn them. Sadly, that's
not the case for most students.

## Final Thoughts

Surprisingly, I don't feel drained today as I write this blog. I guess my body got used
to the routine. The amount of lunch I had is still the same; I had the same dose of my
coffee and three slices of wheat bread for breakfast. That's a good thing, I guess. I hope
I can keep this up.
